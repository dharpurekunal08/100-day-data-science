# 100 Days of Data Science

Welcome to the **100 Days of Data Science** challenge! ðŸš€  
This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning various concepts related to data science, machine learning, and AI over 100 days. Join us as we dive into practical projects, learn new skills, and share progress daily.

## Challenge Overview
- **Duration:** 100 Days
- **Focus:** Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, Data Engineering
- **Daily Goals:** Learn, Practice, Build Projects, Share

## Day 1: Python Basics

Today, we cover the fundamentals of Python, essential for data science:

- **Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`
- **Variables:** Understanding assignment and usage
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.
- **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections; methods like `append()`, `remove()`
- **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections; supports indexing
- **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements; methods like `add()`, `remove()`
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs; methods like `keys()`, `values()`
- **Control Structures:** `if-else`, `for`, and `while` loops
- **Functions:** Defining and calling functions; handling arguments
- **Anonymous Functions:** Created using `lambda`

# Day 2: Python Concepts

Today, we covered the following essential concepts in Python:

## Topics Covered:

1. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return them.
2. **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Includes classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
3. **Iterators**: Objects that allow iteration over a collection using the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.
4. **Scope**: Visibility and lifetime of variables, including local, global, and non-local scopes.
5. **JSON**: Lightweight data interchange format; using the `json` module to work with JSON data.
6. **Exception Handling**: Mechanism to catch and manage errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.

# Day 3: NumPy

## Topics Covered:
- **NumPy Arrays**: Fast, flexible arrays for numerical operations.
- **Array Creation**: Using `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`.
- **Indexing & Slicing**: Accessing and modifying array elements.
- **Array Operations**: Element-wise operations, broadcasting, and math functions (`np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, etc.).
- **Shape Manipulation**: Reshaping with `np.reshape()`, stacking with `np.vstack()`, `np.hstack()`.
- **Statistical Functions**: Basic stats like `np.min()`, `np.max()`, `np.std()`.
- **Random Sampling**: Generating random numbers with `np.random`.

Key takeaways: Efficient array operations and basic statistical analysis in Python.
