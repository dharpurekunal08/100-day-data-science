# 100 Days of Data Science

Welcome to the **100 Days of Data Science** challenge! ðŸš€  
This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning various concepts related to data science, machine learning, and AI over 100 days. Join us as we dive into practical projects, learn new skills, and share progress daily.

## Challenge Overview
- **Duration:** 100 Days
- **Focus:** Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, Data Engineering
- **Daily Goals:** Learn, Practice, Build Projects, Share

## Day 1: Python Basics

Today, we cover the fundamentals of Python, essential for data science:

- **Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`
- **Variables:** Understanding assignment and usage
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.
- **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections; methods like `append()`, `remove()`
- **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections; supports indexing
- **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements; methods like `add()`, `remove()`
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs; methods like `keys()`, `values()`
- **Control Structures:** `if-else`, `for`, and `while` loops
- **Functions:** Defining and calling functions; handling arguments
- **Anonymous Functions:** Created using `lambda`
